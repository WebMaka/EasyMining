    <hr style="height: 1px;" />
    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Getting Started</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're totally new to Litecoin mining, Easy Mining will probably be your new best friend.
    No need to spend a lot of time tweaking command line parameters and messing with batch files -
    just provide some information, click a button, and Easy Mining will configure and launch the
    Litecoin mining software that's appropriate for your computer's hardware.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    There are a few things you'll need to do in order to use Easy Mining, and these steps are
    basically the requirements for both basic and advanced mining, and using Litecoin generally.
    Be sure to perform these in order to get the most out of Easy Mining.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; float: left; margin: 8px;">ONE</span>
    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Download & Install the Litecoin Client</span><br />
    <hr style="height: 1px;" />
  </p>
  <p>
    The first thing you need is a copy of the official Litecoin client. This is a small, free,
    open-source application that acts as both a node on Litecoin's peer-to-peer transaction
    network and provides a "wallet," an encrypted file that "contains" your Litecoins.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://litecoin.org/" rel="external">You can download the official Litecoin 
    client from the official Litecoin information website.</a>
    For your computer's safety, be sure to download <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span>
    the official client, and <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> from the official
    website. If you're more familiar with Litecoin, feel free to investigate some of the 
    unofficial software clients, but if you're new to Litecoin, please stick with the official.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have a copy of the official Litecoin client, run it. It will connect to a few
    "root" Litecoin network nodes, grab a list of other nodes connected to the network, and then
    connect to them. Once that happens, the client will then download a copy of the "blockchain,"
    which is the complete history of all Litecoin transactions. (Please note that the blockchain
    is several gigabytes in size, so plan accordingly in terms of disk space and download time.)
    When you have a complete copy of the blockchain, your client becomes a full participant on 
    the Litecoin network, and your computer will then help check, verify, validate, and store 
    transactions.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    Now that you have the client, all you have to do to create a wallet is, well, nothing - 
    a wallet is created automatically by the client. You will, however, need to create a 
    wallet <span style="font-style: italic;">address</span>. To do this, run the official 
    Litecoin client, click the "Receive Coins" button, then click "New Address." You'll
    be presented with the option to give the new address some sort of name. You can create
    new addresses whenever you want.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; float: left; margin: 8px;">TWO</span>
    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Hook Up With A Mining Pool</span><br />
    <hr style="height: 1px;" />
  </p>
  <p>
    The next thing you're going to need is an account with a Litecoin mining pool. "Pooled mining"
    is a process whereby the effort in producing Litecoins is shared among multiple miners. Pooling
    allows for miners that don't generate a tremendous amount of effort to still get results from
    that shared effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    To join a pool, check out the 
    <a href="https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/wiki/Comparison-of-mining-pools"
      rel="external">list of Litecoin mining pools</a> over on
    <a href="https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin" rel="external">Litecoin's source code 
    repository on GitHub</a>. There are several to choose from, and the mining pool list includes
    information on how pools reward participants, how many kilohashes per second are being pumped
    through the pool, fees each pool charges miners in order to pay for its own operation, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Joining a pool is basically like joining any typical website - create an account by selecting a
    unique user ID and a strong password (you <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> using
    strong passwords, right?), and in some cases, click a link in a verification email.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have an account for the pool you'd like to work with, you may need to create additional 
    username and password combinations for "workers," the individual mining programs you intend to 
    use. Each worker in such a setup will have its own unique username and password and any mining
    done by a miner using those credentials is credited to your main account. Most miners have two
    workers for every computer - one for the miner software that uses the processor, and the other 
    for the miner software that uses the video card. Easy Mining assumes you'll be using both
    processor and video card for mining, so you'll want to set up two workers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Be sure to make a note of the URL and port number the pool uses for communicating. Your workers
    will need to know where to get their work and send back results. If you chose a pool that supports 
    something called "stratum mining," make sure you get the URL and port for the stratum server as
    well - stratum mining uses a slightly different communication protocol that makes it somewhat 
    better than the original method used by Litecoin, so if it's an option it's not a bad idea to
    use stratum mining.
  </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">
    You can do this while the Litecoin client is downloading the blockchain, by the way.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    One last thing... Don't forget to tell the mining pool what your wallet address is, so that the
    pool knows where to send the coins you mine!
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; float: left; margin: 8px;">THREE</span>
    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Cool Your Computer</span><br />
    <hr style="height: 1px;" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Mining generates a lot of waste heat, and that heat can cause harm to the computer. Before
    you begin mining, it's always a good idea to make sure your computer can operate without
    cooking itself. A few suggestions on how to keep your computer cool would be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If any of your computer's case fans don't work, replace them. If any are unplugged, connect
      them. You'll want to move hot air out of the computer's case as quickly and effectively as
      possible.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If your computer lives in a cabinet or some other enclosed space, take it out and set it
      up where air can circulate all around it. Again, heat removal is crucial.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If your motherboard suppports adjusting the processor's cooling fan speed, set it to run
      at full speed. It'll be noisier, but the cooler the processor runs the better it works.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Most reasonably powerful video cards include automatically-adjusting cooling fans that
      wind up to a faster speed when the card heats up, and slow back down for quieter operation
      when the card doesn't have a load on it. The auto-adjust cycles are generally very bad
      for mining as they won't increase the fan speed fast enough to compensate for the severe
      load that comes from mining. So, we <span style="font-weight: bold;">strongly</span>
      suggest that you download a utility that allows you to manually set your video card's fan
      speed to maximum. Again, this means more noise but it also means less heat.<br />
      <br />
      For AMD Radeon video cards, the Catalyst drivers include fan controls. You'll have to enable
      overclocking to gain access to manual fan speed settings. For details on how to do this,
      <a href="http://www.ehow.co.uk/how_8155154_change-ati-gpu-fan-speed.html" 
        rel="external">check these instructions</a>.<br />
      <br />
      For Nvidia GeForce video cards, there are a few really good utilities that enable manual 
      fan speed control. Arguably the most popular is 
      <a href="http://event.msi.com/vga/afterburner/download.htm" rel="external">MSI's Afterburner</a>, 
      which works on most of the current GeForce line.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Where possible, keep the room cool and/or vent the heat from the computer to the outside.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; float: left; margin: 8px;">FOUR</span>
    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Update Your Drivers</span><br />
    <hr style="height: 1px;" />
  </p>
  <p>
    If you intend to do any sort of video card mining, make sure your video card drivers are 
    up to date. Be sure to grab the latest full-version driver package for your video card,
    but <span style="font-style: italic;">avoid beta drivers</span>, as Litecoin mining is 
    a brutally tough task and buggy beta drivers are usually inadequate for the task.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once your video card drivers are up to date, you'll also need the software development
    kit (SDK) for either OpenCL or CUDA applications. These will provide the additional drivers
    that the video card mining application will need in order to send program code to the 
    video card's graphics processor. For Radeon based video card, you'll need the
    <a href="http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/heterogeneous-computing/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/downloads/" 
      rel="external">AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing (APP) SDK</a> along with the latest
    AMD Catalyst driver package. Nvidia users will instead need to grab the
    <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads" rel="external">Nvidia CUDA SDK</a>
    along with the latest WHQL-ceritifed non-beta driver package.
  </p>
  <p>
    By the way, once you've updated your drivers and installed the appropriate SDK,
    <span style="font-style: italic;">reboot your computer</span>. Yeah yeah, we know you hate
    having to reboot arbitrarily, but if you don't, core components won't load and your miner
    will probably crash. Better to just take the few minutes to close everything and restart
    than to fight against partially-loaded software.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; float: left; margin: 8px;">FIVE</span>
    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Configure Easy Mining</span><br />
    <hr style="height: 1px;" />
  </p>
  <p>
    So you have the Litecoin client, the blockchain, the pool account, and at the username and 
    password for least one worker, preferably two. Now it's time to set up Easy Mining. But
    don't worry, this may well be the easiest part of the whole process!
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the Easy Mining configuration window. We'll discuss what does what in a moment...
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/em_configuration.png" 
      style="height: 464px; width: 577px; border: none;" />
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Stratum Mining Proxy"</span><br />
    If your pool supports stratum mining, enter the pool's stratum-mining server's IP address,
    URL, or hostname in the left box and the port (usually 3333) in the right box. Check the 
    "Use Stratum Mining Proxy" option - this setting will cause Easy Mining to load a special
    tool called a "stratum proxy" that acts as a bridge, and will set the processor miner to 
    use the stratum proxy. Depending on which brand of video card you have, it may also set the
    video card miner to use the proxy as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Processor Mining"</span><br />
    In addition to the mining server's IP address, URL, or hostname, note that there are also
    boxes for a username and a password - these are for the worker you'd like to use for mining
    with your processor. If you do not wish to use your processor to mine, leave any or all of 
    the boxes in this section blank.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that if you enable the "Use Stratum Mining Proxy" option, you won't be able to 
    change the host and port, as Easy Mining will automatically set these to "localhost" and "8332"
    so that the processor mining software will connect to the stratum proxy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Video Card Mining"</span><br />
    These settings are for the worker you'd like to use for mining with your video card, and the
    basic idea is the same as for processor mining. Be sure to not use the same username and 
    password you used in the processor mining settings, as the mining pool server will get all
    confused and upset and you may end up not generating any Litecoins. Again, if you do not wish 
    to use your video card to mine, leave any or all of the boxes in this section blank.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, please note that if you enable the "Use Stratum Mining Proxy" option, you won't be able to
    change the host and port. If you are using a Radeon based video card, the mining software will
    automatically connect to the stratum server, and if your video card is Nvidia based, the
    mining software will be set to connect through the stratum proxy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The "Aggressive Mining" setting is an important option to mention. When enabled, "Aggressive
    Mining" mode causes Easy Mining to configure the mining software to use the maximum amount
    of computing power possible. This usually makes a computer otherwise unusable, as the processor
    and video card will be devoting every bit of their effort to mining and not to things like
    having an interactive desktop and a mouse pointer that moves smoothly. Aggressive mining also
    causes visual errors, artifacting, and all sorts of other odd behavior. If you want to mine
    on a computer but also want to be able to use it, leave this option disabled.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; float: left; margin: 8px;">SIX</span>
    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Mine Away</span><br />
    <hr style="height: 1px;" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you reach this point, there's only one thing left: mining! Click the "Save Settings
    & Start Mining" button and Easy Mining will do its thing. Here's what happens at that point:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the "Use Stratum Mining Proxy" option is checked, Easy Mining will launch a proxy
      server for stratum mining, and wait ten seconds for it to connect.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Easy Mining will check to see if you've provided server and username/password information
      for video card mining. If so, Easy Mining will launch one of two video card mining applications:
      "cgminer.exe" for Radeon-based video cards, and "cudaminer.exde" for NVidia GeForce video cards.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Easy Mining will also check to see if you've provided a mining pool server and a username/password
      pair for processor mining. If so, Easy Mining will launch a processor mining application called
      "minerd.exe," in either 32-bit or 64-bit form depending on which version of Windows you're
      using.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Easy Mining will display a running log of what the mining applications are reporting, and 
      a copy of the live report is recorded as a file in the 
      "(Windows Drive)\Users\Public\Documents\EasyMining\logs" directory.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When you're done mining, you can simply close Easy Mining - the miner applications will
    be closed automatically.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; float: left; margin: 8px;">SEVEN</span>
    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Profit!</span><br />
    <hr style="height: 1px;" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Assuming everything went well up to this point, you should eventually start to see Litecoins 
    from your mining pool. As a quick way to make sure all is in fact going well, log into your
    mining pool account after Easy Mining has had 15-30 minutes to run mining applications, and 
    you should see a non-zero kilohash-per-second reading. (If you don't, stop Easy Mining and 
    check the most recent log file in the "(Windows Drive)\Users\Public\Documents\EasyMining\logs" 
    directory - it should give you a clue as to why your miners aren't showing up on the pool.)
